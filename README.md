# ðŸŽ‰ Birthday Bot ðŸŽ‚
To Rafael, who inspired me to create this project

A Discord bot that reminds your server when it's someone's birthday! It allows users to register their birthdays, lists all registered birthdays, and sends a message in a specified channel on the special day.

## Features

- **Register Birthdays**: Users can register their birthdays using the `/date` command.
- **Birthday Reminders**: The bot sends a message in a specified channel on a user's birthday.
- **List Birthdays**: Admins and users can view all registered birthdays using the `/birthdays` command.
